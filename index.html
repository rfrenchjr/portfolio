            Roger French is a problem solver. His background in project management, customer service, project estimating and game mastering informs his ability to continually work a problem until a solution is found. He brings this mindset into the field of front end web design with the goal of solving the problem of turning thoughtfully planned ideas into concrete workable products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roger is passionate about finding creative solutions to complex challenges and working with others. He considers teamwork essential to expanding our worldview whether it’s on a work project, the soccer field, a tabletop RPG, or a competitive video game, we achieve more working together than we can achieve individually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roger’s attention to detail and team focused approach was instrumental in managing a multi-million dollar inventory of raw steel products as well as a small team of material handlers at Springs Fabrication ensuring the right inventory was on hand and in-place for production. Roger stepped into a vacated shipping and receiving management position at InnovaFlex Foundry and worked with the team there to rewrite the library of operating procedure documentation for the department. Roger is an avid game master organizing and running successful campaigns in a variety of systems and settings for friends, acquaintances and total strangers building camaraderie around the table with his engagement and friendly personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roger is currently expanding his knowledge of front end engineering and programming languages and looking for opportunities as a junior web developer.
